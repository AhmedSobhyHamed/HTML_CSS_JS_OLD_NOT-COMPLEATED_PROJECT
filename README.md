## Introduction

This project is a gallery to share pictures with your friends on the site.
<br>
I decided to code this front-end project to practice while I was learning PHP. However, it was deprecated in the end, and I stored it for the future in case I decide to continue developing it. I organized it into separate pages and restructured the libraries for each page.

**this is a collection of a pages that was a part of a not compleated niglicted project.**

## Features

- Create responsive web pages.
- Use pre-made custom CSS libraries.
- Create a drag and drop area to upload a file.
- Create a dropdown menu.
- Validate the file type.
- Validate the file size.
